# How-Artificial-Intelligence-AI-Impacts-the-Economy

Abstract
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in modern economies, reshaping
industries, labor markets, and global growth trajectories. This report delves into AI’s historical
development, current applications, and future potential, emphasizing its economic implications.
From the foundational work of Alan Turing to recent breakthroughs like AlphaGo, the study
highlights key milestones and challenges. AI has been able, based on deep analysis supported by
evidence from credible databases such as the OECD, McKinsey, and the IMF, to create $15.7
trillion toward global GDP until 2030. The work would therefore hope to apply the knowledge of
a possible maximum economic benefit that AI can offer amidst ethical and social problems.
Introduction
Overview of Artificial Intelligence and Its Role in the Economy
Artificial Intelligence, defined by the OECD as “systems designed to act with a level of autonomy
to achieve goals,” has become integral to economic transformation (OECD, 2023). Its applications,
from enhancing productivity in manufacturing to driving innovation in healthcare, are projected to
significantly impact global GDP. According to McKinsey's The Future of Work, 2023, AI could
automate as much as 50% of routine work tasks in the next decade to come, freeing resources for
higher-value activities but also creating challenges in labor markets.
